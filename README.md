Massive Dangerzone
==================

Summary
------------------

Massive-Dangerzone, abreviated madz, is a plugin management system built on python. Plugins can be written in any supported programming language. Plugins communicate through their CFFI (C Foreign Function Interface), often wrapped by support source files to ease programmer usability. Wrapper files are generated from an intermediate description language, MDL (Madz Description Language).

Currently supported languages:
* C
* C++
* Python3

Future Improvements
------------------

Planed languages:
* Scheme
* Haskell
* JVM/Java (Although any java language would likely work well through their java compatability interface).

Other features:
* Development Modes
* Custom Commands
* Packaging
* Dynamic Plugin Loading
* Self Implementation (Implementing Madz as a Madz plugin system.)
* Standard Library
* MDL Extensions (Datatypes, Objects)
* Static Compilation
