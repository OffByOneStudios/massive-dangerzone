Massive Dangerzone
==================

### Version: 0.5.0-dev ([CHANGES](https://github.com/OffByOneStudios/massive-dangerzone/blob/master/CHANGES.md))

Summary
------------------

Massive-Dangerzone, abbreviated madz, is an extensible module management system built on python. Modules can be written in any programming language (extensible), against any runtime (extensible), for any platform (extensible). Modules communicate through any method they support (for example, via their CFFIs). Modules can have additional code generated for them from their source, a specific example is MDL (Madz Description Language) which describes to madz in an extensible declaritive way, what each module does.

**This codebase is still a work in progress, indeed this project is as much research as it is development.**
