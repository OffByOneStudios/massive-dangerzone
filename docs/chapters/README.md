This folder contains design documents for madz. Each file is a "chapter" on a subject. Some different types of subjects:

* Concept: Describe a concept or idea used by madz, often with examples outside of the madz implementation.
* Design: A design for a portion of madz. Namely implementation details.

At the top of each chapter are some directives for organizing and interpreting the chapter.

Please use an index to read the chapters:

* [[Index]InOrder](./[Index]InOrder.md)
* [[Index]ByPart](./[Index]ByPart.md)
